# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Introduction

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It features a robust authentication system with login and registration capabilities, and it dynamically displays different dashboard views based on the user's role. This allows for granular access control, ensuring that users see only the data and operations they are authorized for.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Different dashboard views based on user roles.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on Node.js and MongoDB for performance and scalability.
- **Secure**: Implements best practices in security and data protection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12.0 or higher recommended)
- MongoDB (v4.0 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone link
   cd your-rbac-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and include the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   PORT=3000
   SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
   ```

4. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

#### Logging In and Registration

- To register a new user, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register` and enter the required information.
- To log in, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login` and enter your credentials.

#### Accessing the Dashboard

- Once logged in, users will be redirected to their respective dashboards based on their assigned role.
- Each role has access to different features and data, according to the access control policies set up in the system.
